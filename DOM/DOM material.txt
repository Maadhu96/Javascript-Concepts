 What is the DOM?
* The Dom is a application programming interface for HMTL & XML documents
* it defines the logical structure of document and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 
* It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
* Using the DOM we can access the anything found in HTML & XML, and we can modify,add,& delete the content
* The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects;
* A web page is a document that can be displayed in browser window or in HTML page in both the case document is same. 
But in the DOM(Document object Model) we can maniplate the web page using Javascript language.
*  DOM structure models is structural isomorphism: if any two Document Object Model implementations are used to create 
a representation of the same document, they will create the same structure model, with precisely the same objects and relationships.
